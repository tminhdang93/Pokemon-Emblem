Welcome to Pokemon Emblem by Tam Dang, Joseph He and Dylan Nguyen
This game is a turn based game where you have two players who can select their own pokemon and move it towards the enemy's
Each player has 6 pokemon, with a unique moveset, players take turns to move their pokemon and also during battle.
You have move through the board with the arrow keys, and you select your pokemon by pressing the Z key twice, you press X once you are done 
with your turn(moving pokemon/battle), the battle phase occurs in the terminal window, where you enter numbers between 1-4 to attack.
The winners pokemon's Health Points and stats get reset after every battle, the first team that losses 6 pokemon will lose, 
granting victory to the enemy.

Note:
If you are player 1, the one who starts on the left hand side, you CAN ONLY BATTLE AGAINST an ENEMY on your RIGHT.
While if you are player 2, you can ONLY BATTLE AGAINST an ENEMY on your LEFT.

The battle phase should auto start once two enemy pokemon are together like stated above, however, sometimes
you need to press Z to start the battle(rare)

The battle phase is autorun and you do not need to press anything in between turns, in the rare scenario you tap on 
another window aside from the terminal/game window then you may need to reselect the game window for the battle phase in the terminal
to keep operating.
